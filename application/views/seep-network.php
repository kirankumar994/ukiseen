						<p>Social Entrepreneurship in India, notwithstanding its visible growth, remains on the fringe of entrepreneurial landscape. The “Mainstreaming of Social Entrepreneurship Education in India” programme managed by EDII, in collaboration with the University of East London (UEL), seeks to inject enthusiasm and competency for social entrepreneurship education. This is supported by the British Council, New Delhi under their aegis of Social Enterprise Education Programme (SEEP), a significant initiative by the Council in facilitating social entrepreneurship education in India.</p>
						<p>The primary purpose of SEEP is to build a social enterprise ecosystem in education domain and to strengthen it both in policy making and its practice. It intends to do so by introducing it into formal education system, blending Indian knowledge/practice with global one. This would lay ground for social entrepreneurship education through development of curriculum and learning material resource. It promotes innovation on social entrepreneurship education through tie-ups with incubation centres and a higher education oriented network. Given the size of the country and complexity, the programme focuses on eight low income states and Gujarat in the context of programme work.</p>
						<p>Dr Sanjay Pal and Mr S.S. Modi, Faculty Members of EDII attended the Round Table on 31st March 2016 at University of East London, U.K. to make a presentation on EDII’s approach, rationale and also share their experience in Social Entrepreneurship Education.</p>

						<p><strong>Five Regional Advisory Group (RAG) meetings</strong> were held at Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Lucknow, Bhubaneshwar and Kolkata. More than eighty participants across eight states helped generate ideas for effective introduction of social entrepreneurship in the formal education system. This group was a rich blend of academia, policy makers, social entrepreneurs and business membership organisations (BMOs). The critical discussion helped us develop keen insights on the pedagogy, curriculum and evaluation of the subject.</p>

						<p>Prof Andre and Prof Tim of University of East London visited EDII and interacted with the students of EDII. The learnings from the RAGs and due discussions with our partners at University of East London (UEL) helped in planning and developing viable knowledge, skill networks and curricula besides the course content for social entrepreneurship for the MOOC platform. Plans for Training of teachers and accreditation were also discussed. The Indian audience and its need are being kept in mind while developing the course content. The curriculum being developed under the SEEP project should soon be up on the website. UEL also encouraged social entrepreneurship ventures at EDII. A Network on Social Entrepreneurship Education (NSSEE) is also being strengthened.</p>

					<h4>Sensitization Workshop Concluded At Ahmedabad</h4>
					<div class="col-sm-12 seed-cont">
						<p>Under the aegis of British Council, EDII in partnership with University of East London is helping in mainstreaming social entrepreneurship education across disciplines. The primary purpose is to build social entrepreneurship in education systems and to strengthen policy and practice of embedding social entrepreneurship in the curricula of higher educational institutions in India and the United Kingdom. We have already been in consultation with various enthusiastic stakeholders of the education system through the regional advisory group meetings. These discussions were highly useful and helped us to consolidate various perspectives before launching an appropriate strategy to mainstream social entrepreneurship in our Indian education system.</p>
						<p>It is against this background that a sensitization workshop was organized on 20th September 2016 at EDII Gandhinagar. Dr Sunil Shukla, Director EDII welcomed Ms Moumita Bhattacharya, Head British Council Ahmedabad and gave the inaugural address. Ms Bhattacharya shared the role of British Council in India and an overview of the project .The real life experiences of two social entrepreneurs, Ms Sonal Mehta and Mr Pritesh Bhatia, who are also academicians, were shared helping to develop keen insights on the subject. Dr Bhavesh Pandya discussed how social entrepreneurship was getting huge attention in academics and one could see its positive impact. The objective of the workshop was to understand the diverse scope of social entrepreneurship across multi-disciplinary education system.</p>
